# chrome-rtf-viewer
This chrome extension allows to view RTF (Rich Text Format) files in the browser and does so automatically when clicking any link to an RTF file. The RTF file is then automatically rendered in the same tab (similarly to the pdf preview feature of most browsers). This plugin does not depend on any external services to generate the preview.
